                    <h2>About Dialysis</h2>
                    <p>Hemodialysis is a medical procedure for individuals with kidney failure. 
                        During this process, blood is circulated through a machine that acts as an artificial kidney, removing waste products and excess fluids.
                        A dialyzer, comprising semipermeable membranes, filters toxins from the blood. The machine then returns purified blood to the patient.
                        Typically performed three times a week, each session lasts about 3-5 hours. 
                        Hemodialysis helps maintain a balance of electrolytes and fluid in the body, 
                        managing blood pressure and preventing complications associated with kidney failure.
                        While it sustains life, a kidney transplant is often considered a more permanent solution for eligible patients. </p>
